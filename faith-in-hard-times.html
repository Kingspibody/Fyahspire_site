  <h1>⛰️ Faith in Hard Times</h1>
  <p>We all face seasons of hardship—moments where everything seems to fall apart, and life feels too heavy to bear. But it’s in these moments that our faith is tested, strengthened, and purified.</p>

  <p>The Bible reminds us in <strong>James 1:2-3</strong>, “Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.”</p>

  <p>Hard times are not meant to break you but to build you. God doesn’t abandon His children in difficulty—He walks with them through the fire. Think of Job, Joseph, or Paul. They each endured suffering, but their stories didn’t end in defeat. They ended in glory and purpose.</p>

  <h2>🙌 What Should You Do When Times Are Hard?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pray continuously</strong> – Pour out your heart to God. He hears every cry.</li>
    <li><strong>Stay in the Word</strong> – Let Scripture anchor your soul in the storm.</li>
    <li><strong>Surround yourself with believers</strong> – You were never meant to walk alone.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep trusting</strong> – Even when you don’t understand, keep walking by faith, not by sight.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📖 Hold On to God’s Promises</h2>
  <p>Romans 8:28 says, “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him.” This means your pain has purpose. Your tears are not wasted. Your struggle is not in vain. God is doing something in you and for you—even when it’s hidden from your eyes.</p>

  <p>Faith in hard times is not about denying the struggle—it’s about declaring that God is bigger than the struggle.</p>

  <h3>🔥 Stay strong. God is with you. This too shall pass.</h3>

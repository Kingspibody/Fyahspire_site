  <h1>🔥 The Call of Salvation: Come Just As You Are</h1>

  <p>“Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” — <strong>Matthew 11:28</strong></p>

  <p>Salvation is not about being perfect. It’s not about fixing yourself before coming to God. It’s about accepting the free gift Jesus Christ offers through His death and resurrection.</p>

  <p>Right now, wherever you are, the call is being made: <strong>Come to Jesus</strong>. Not tomorrow. Not next week. <em>Now</em>. The blood of Jesus is enough to wash away every sin — no matter how dark your past has been.</p>

  <p>He knows your pain. He sees your tears. He understands your struggle. And yet, His arms are still open wide. That’s grace. That’s love. That’s the power of the cross.</p>

  <p>There’s a place for you in the Kingdom. Don’t let guilt hold you back. Don’t let shame silence your response. Jesus died for you — and today He says, <strong>“Follow Me.”</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Will you answer His call?</strong></p>

  <p><em>Say this from your heart:</em></p>
  <blockquote>
    Lord Jesus, I believe You died for me and rose again. I confess my sins and ask You to come into my heart. Be my Savior, my Lord, and my God. I receive Your gift of salvation. Amen.
  </blockquote>

  <p>If you said that prayer, <strong>welcome to the family of God!</strong> Get a Bible, start reading the Word, and connect with a local church or Christian group near you.</p>

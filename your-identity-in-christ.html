  <h1>👑 Your Identity in Christ</h1>
  <p>One of the most important truths a believer can ever discover is this: <strong>Your identity is not in your past, your mistakes, your talents, or what others say — your identity is in Christ.</strong></p>

  <p>2 Corinthians 5:17 says, “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.”</p>

  <p>When you gave your life to Jesus, something powerful happened. You were spiritually reborn. You were adopted into God's family. You became royalty, a child of the King!</p>

  <h2>Here’s who you are in Christ:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>✅ You are loved (Romans 8:38-39)</li>
    <li>✅ You are chosen (1 Peter 2:9)</li>
    <li>✅ You are redeemed (Ephesians 1:7)</li>
    <li>✅ You are more than a conqueror (Romans 8:37)</li>
    <li>✅ You are seated with Christ in heavenly places (Ephesians 2:6)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The enemy wants to confuse your identity and make you feel like you’re not enough — but God’s Word says you are complete in Christ (Colossians 2:10).</p>

  <p>Don’t let the world define you. Let your Creator define you. Walk boldly in who you are, not who you used to be.</p>

  <p><strong>You are not what you did — you are what Jesus did for you.</strong></p>

  <p>Live like it. Think like it. Speak like it. You belong to Christ! 👑</p>
